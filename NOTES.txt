This should be an inspectably impact-free change, at the cost of readability;
that is, a reviewer should be able to tell easiliy from each commit that, when
cca_in_ad is false, the behavior does not change.

When the cca_in_ad setting is true:

* AD sends CCA configs for containers without other LogsConfig
    * [DONE] AD no longer sends service configs (FIXME's)
    * [WIP] AD sends CCA configs -- need to figure out what these look like

* Logs-Agent doesn't handle services anymore
    * [DONE] AD logs scheduler does not send services
    * [DONE] CCA scheduler disabled
    * [DONE] k8s launcher disabled
    * [DONE] Docker launcher only pairs sources with services if feature flag is false

* Logs-Agent handles CCA configs
    * always handled by the (new) container launcher, creating child sources with
      Config.Type=FileType when necessary.
    * set source, service correctly
        * [WIP] let's put this byzantine logic in a new module
    * Container launcher recognizes kcur, dcur, force_dcur, path accessibility,
      LogWhat, and registry in deciding whether to log a container from socket or file
        * [WIP] let's put this byzantine logic in a new module
    * some of this stuff is in dustin.mitchell/ac-1644-backup


TODO
 - working on a presentation of scenarios in
   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B_dJ3N-scZnY0QYUexYz-xC9uUvuvnM6k5v7lm6097w/edit#slide=id.g12a28993b63_0_0
   but the annotated-container-source-service is not behaving right?!
   - updating scenarios/ with re-runs, based on 7.36.0
   - patched 7.36.0 with logging in `dustin.mitchell/ac-1644-logging-on-7-36` branch, image `dustin-mitchell-ac-1644-logging-on-7-36-py3`
   - need to re-run gke, minikube stuff
 - new scenarios:
   - k8s annotation pointing to a file mounted on the host - https://github.com/DataDog/croissant-integration-resources/blob/master/logs-agent/qa/kubernetes/file-tailing-from-ad/logs-both.yaml

 - several scenarios for heisenbugs with annotation changes, but this doesn't
   work and is out of scope for presentation
 - figure out how AD's approach to annotations differs from logs-agent -- do
   we stil get annotated containers from AD?
 - Older WIP notes were in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_CHN5FShB6f69d0OJRRxqRBkOSMVrROMNOTFTlUnRQ/edit
 - do not try to solve k8s+containerd issues, but don't make them worse
